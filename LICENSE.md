Roblox Studio
﻿1. License to Use Studio.
    
   A. Studio. “Studio” is our free software tool which allows you to create,
      develop, modify, and release your UGC. Roblox owns or controls all 
      rights in Studio and all elements contained therein. 
    
   B. Grant. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a 
      non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable 
      license to use Studio solely for the purpose of creating, developing,
      modifying, uploading, and releasing your UGC on the Platform (the
      “License”).
    
   C. Termination of Studio License. We reserve the right to terminate this 
      License at any time and for any reason. 
    
   D. Restrictions. You can only use Studio in a way consistent with these
      Terms, and you cannot: (i) copy, modify or create derivative works of
      Studio, in whole or in part; (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble, 
      decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access
      to Studio source code, in whole or in part (unless a portion of code 
      contained within Studio is released as open source and the open source
      license governing such code expressly permits reverse engineering, 
      copying or other modification); (iii) use Studio to create malicious or
      abusive content (as determined by Roblox) or any content that violates
      a Roblox guideline or policy; or (iv) use Studio in any manner that 
      infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any intellectual 
      property right or other right of any person, or that violates any 
      applicable laws.
    
   E. Open Source Licenses.
      1. Incorporation in Studio. Notwithstanding the foregoing License 
         grant, certain components of Studio (“Open Source Components”) may
         be covered by so-called “open source” software licenses, which means
         any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open
         Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses.  A list of
         Open Source Components and their licenses is available at
         "File/About Roblox" window. By using Studio, you acknowledge receipt
         of license notices for the Open Source Components. To the extent
         required by the licenses covering third party Open Source
         Components, the terms of such licenses will apply to such Open 
         Source Components in lieu of the terms of this License.  To the
         extent the terms of the licenses applicable to third party Open
         Source Components prohibit any of the restrictions in this License
         with respect to such Open Source Components, such restrictions will
         not apply to such Open Source Components. To the extent the terms of
         the licenses applicable to third party Open Source Components
         require us to make an offer to provide source code or related
         information in connection with the Open Source Components, such
         offer is hereby made.  Any request for source code or related
         information should be directed only to:
         studio-license-requests@roblox.com.
           
      2. Release of Studio. We may make certain components of Studio separately 
         generally available under open source or other royalty-free licenses. 
         This Agreement will not vitiate the rights granted to you under
         those licenses.
